# ObjectRecognitionWithWithoutObjects

The data creation code for the paper Object Reconition with and without Objects (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596).

We provide the MATLAB code to generate the foreground image data and background image data of the ImageNet 2012, which are used for training the AlexNet in our paper.

You need the ImageNet 2012 training, val datasets and the xml bounding boxes annotations before you can run this code.
